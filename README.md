# The Route to DevOps

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a cultural, organizational, and technical movement that aims to unify and automate software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It focuses on collaboration, efficiency, and continuous delivery to enable faster, reliable, and secure software deployment. By breaking down silos between development and operations teams, DevOps helps businesses respond more quickly to market needs while improving system reliability.
