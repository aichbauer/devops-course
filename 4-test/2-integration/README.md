# Integration Tests

## What is a Integration Test?

An integration test is a type of software testing that verifies the interactions and data flow between different components, modules, or systems in an application. It ensures that individual units (which have been tested separately during unit testing) work together as expected when integrated.

These components, modules and systems can be your database, an internal or external api (e.g., another (micro)-service of your application).


## Why Test These Integrations?

Integration tests for databases, APIs, and other systems are crucial because:

* **Dependencies**: Applications often rely on external or internal systems, and integration failures can cause significant issues.
* **Complex Workflows**: Real-world applications involve workflows spanning multiple components.
* **Data Consistency**: Ensures data integrity and consistency across systems.
* **Error Handling**: Validates that errors (e.g., failed API calls, database connection issues) are handled gracefully.

By including these systems in integration tests, developers can identify and fix problems early, ensuring a robust and reliable application.
