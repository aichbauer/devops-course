# Security Scans (Snyk)

## What is a Security Scan?

A security scan is an automated process that identifies vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and misconfigurations within an application, system, or infrastructure. By scanning code, dependencies, containers, and configurations, security tools help developers and security teams detect potential risks early in the software development lifecycle.

Security scans are essential for:

* **Proactively managing risks**: Detect vulnerabilities before they are exploited
* **Maintaining compliance**: Ensure adherence to security standards and regulations
* **Improving code quality**: Identify insecure practices and fix them early

## What is Snyk?

Snyk is a developer-focused security platform designed to help teams find and fix vulnerabilities in their code, dependencies, containers, and infrastructure as code (IaC).

Snyk supports key stages of application security, including:

1. Identifying vulnerabilities
2. Prioritizing risks
3. Offering detailed recommendations for fixing issues

### What is Vulnerability Management in Snyk?

Vulnerability management in Snyk involves identifying, prioritizing, and remediating vulnerabilities in your application stack. Snyk scans for:

* Known vulnerabilities in open-source libraries
* Security flaws in custom code

Once vulnerabilities are identified, Snyk provides:

* **Severity Ratings**: Help prioritize fixes based on the risk level
* **Detailed Fix Guidance**: Clear steps and automated patches to resolve issues quickly
* **Continuous Monitoring**: Tracks changes in your codebase to detect new vulnerabilities

### What is Dependency Scanning in Snyk?

Modern applications rely on third-party libraries and frameworks. Dependency scanning in Snyk identifies vulnerabilities in these open-source dependencies and helps mitigate risks.

Key features of Snykâ€™s dependency scanning:

* **Real-Time Insights**: Instantly highlights vulnerable packages in your project
* **Automated Fixes**: Provides suggested upgrades or patches for vulnerable libraries

Snyk integrates with popular package managers (e.g., npm, Maven, PyPI) and build tools to streamline dependency management and keep applications secure.

### What is Container Security in Snyk?

Containers are part of software delivery, but they can introduce vulnerabilities through insecure base images and configurations. Container security in Snyk ensures that your containerized applications remain secure.

Key aspects include:

* **Image Scanning**: Analyzes Docker and Kubernetes images for vulnerabilities
* **Base Image Recommendations**: Suggests secure alternatives to vulnerable base images
* **Continuous Monitoring**: Tracks changes to containers and alerts on emerging threats

### What is Infrastructure as Code Secuirty in Snyk?

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) allows you to define and provision infrastructure through code. However, misconfigurations in IaC templates can lead to security risks. IaC security in Snyk scans these configurations for vulnerabilities and ensures compliance with best practices.

Supported IaC tools include Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes, and more. Snyk identifies:

* Misconfigurations (e.g., open security groups, overly permissive IAM roles).
* Non-compliance with industry standards (e.g., CIS Benchmarks).

### What is License Compliance in Snyk?

Organizations using open-source dependencies must ensure compliance with licensing requirements. License compliance in Snyk helps teams:

* Detect open-source licenses in use across projects.
* Identify and flag high-risk licenses (e.g., GPL, AGPL).
* Maintain compliance with company policies and legal requirements.
