# User Stories and Acceptance Criteria

A **user story** is a short, simple description of a feature told from the perspective of the user, customer or role. It defines what the user needs or wants to do with the system, in the following format:

As a **[type of user]**, I want to **[do something]** so that **[I can achieve a goal]**.

**Acceptance criteria** are the conditions that must be met for a user story to be considered complete and acceptable. They act as a to-do list that outlines the specific requirements, behavior, and outcomes that must be satisfied for the feature to work as intended.

## Examples of User Stories

### **Frontend: User Registration Form**
   **As a** new user,
   **I want to** fill out a registration form with my details,
   **so that** I can create an account and access the website.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**
   - A registration form with fields for `name`, `email`, and `password`.
   - Validation to ensure email format is correct and password meets security standards.
   - Display error messages for invalid input.
   - A success message in form of a toast after successful registration.
   - An error message in form of a toast after unsuccessful registration (e.g., username is already taken).
   - Redirect to Dashboard after a successfull registration.

### **API: Add User Authentication Endpoint**
   **As a** backend developer,
   **I want to** implement a user authentication API endpoint,
   **so that** users can securely log in with their username and password and receive a JWT token for subsequent requests.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**
   - A POST endpoint `/api/tokens` is created.
   - Valid username and password return a JWT token.
   - Invalid username or password return an appropriate error message (`401 Unauthorized`).
   - Token expiry time is configurable.

### **Infrastructure: Set Up Monitoring and Alerts for API**
   **As a** DevOps engineer,
   **I want to** set up monitoring and alerting for the API services,
   **so that** I can be notified immediately if there are any issues like downtime, slow response times, or errors.

   **Acceptance Criteria:**
   - Implement monitoring using Grafana.
   - Set up alerts for high error rates, slow response times, and downtime.
   - Alerts should be sent to the relevant Slack channel and email list.
   - Ensure monitoring provides insights into API usage and server health.
