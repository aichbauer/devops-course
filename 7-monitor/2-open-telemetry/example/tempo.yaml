server:
  http_listen_port: 3100
  # Defines the HTTP port where the Tempo server listens for incoming API and query requests.

distributor:
  receivers:
    otlp:
      # Configures the OTLP receiver to accept telemetry data (traces).
      protocols:
        grpc:
          endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317

  # Specifies the duration to wait before finalizing a trace when no new spans are received (idle period).

  max_block_bytes: 1048576  # 1MiB in bytes
  # Sets the maximum size of a trace block in bytes. Once this limit is reached, the block is finalized and written to storage.

querier:
  frontend_worker:
    frontend_address: 127.0.0.1:9095
    # Configures the querier to connect to a query frontend at the specified address and port (127.0.0.1:9095).
    # The query frontend coordinates and optimizes query handling for Tempo.

storage:

    backend: local
    # Sets the storage backend for trace data. "local" indicates that traces will be stored on the local filesystem.
    local:
      path: /tmp/tempo/traces
