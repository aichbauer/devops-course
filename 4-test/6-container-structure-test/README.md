# Container Structure Test

## What is a Container Structure Test?

A Container Structure Test is a method for validating the contents and structure of a container image to ensure it meets specified standards, configurations, and best practices. It allows developers and operations teams to verify that a container is built correctly, includes the necessary files and dependencies, and behaves as expected before deployment.

## What Do We Need to Validate in a Container Structure Test?

1. Validation of File System Contents
2. Validation of Environment Variables
3. Validation of Command Execution
4. Metadata Validation
5. Validation of Dependencies

## What Do We Need For Container Structure Tests?

1. Built container image
2. Test configuration file (YAML/JSON)
3. Structure testing tool (e.g., Googleâ€™s Container Structure Test)
4. Optional: A container runtime (e.g., Docker)
5. Optional: CI/CD integration for automated testing

## What Are the Benefits of a Container Structure Test?

1. Ensures Consistency Across Environments
2. Early Detection of Issues
3. Enhanced Security
4. Automatable in CI/CD Pipelines
5. Validates Image Standards and Best Practices
6. Reduces Deployment Risks
7. Promotes Collaboration
8. Simplifies Debugging

## Example of a Container Structure Test

```yaml
# container-structure-test.yaml
schemaVersion: "2.0.0"
fileExistenceTests:
- name: "Check package.json existence"
  path: "/app/package.json"
  shouldExist: true

fileContentTests:
- name: "Check package.json content"
  path: "/app/package.json"
  expectedContents: [
    '"private": true'
  ]

metadataTest:
  envVars:
    - key: NODE_VERSION
      value: 20.2.0
```
