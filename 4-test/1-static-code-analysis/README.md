# Static Code Analysis

## What is a Static Code Analysis?

Static Code Analysis is the process of testing source code without executing it. This analysis is performed to identify code quality issues, potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and adherence to coding standards. Tools automate this process, helping developers with to improve the overall quality and maintainability of their code.

## What Do We Need to Validate in a Static Code Analysis?

Static Code Analysis typically validates the following aspects:

- **1. Syntax Errors**
   - Detect invalid code that would fail to compile or interpret
   - Ensure that the code conforms to the basic rules of the programming language
- **2. Code Quality**
   - Check for **code smells**, such as:
     - Duplicated code
     - Overly complex methods or functions
     - Poor naming conventions that hinder readability
   - Highlight areas that may reduce maintainability
- **3. Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Identify potential risks, including:
     - SQL injection
     - Cross-Site Scripting
     - Insecure handling of sensitive data
   - Detect weak encryption practices or exposed secrets in the code
- **4. Coding Standards**
   - Validate compliance with organizational or language-specific style guides
   - Ensure consistent formatting and naming conventions
- **5. Performance Issues**
   - Detect inefficient algorithms that could cause performance bottlenecks
   - Identify resource leaks or unnecessary dependencies
   - Highlight opportunities for optimization

## What Do We Need For Static Code Analysis?

* **1. Static Analysis Tools**: ESlint (JavaScript), pylint (python), SonarQube (multi-language)
* **2. Codebase Access**
* **3. Configuration Files**: `.eslint`, `.pylintrc`, `.sonar-project.properties`
* **4. Team Standards**: coding standards and practices to guide the configuration of analysis tools

## What Are the Benefits of a Static Code Analysis?

Static Code Analysis provides several advantages that improve the overall quality, security, and maintainability of a codebase.

## Example of a Static Code Analysis

```
# start sonarqube in docker
$ docker run --detach --name sonarqube --env SONAR_ES_BOOTSTRAP_CHECKS_DISABLE=true --publish 9000:9000 sonarqube:latest
```

Log in to http://localhost:9000 using default credentials:

* login: admin
* password: admin

1. Create a project
2. Cerate a project key
3. Add the project key to the `sonar-project.properties` in your project
4. Run the scanner locally (optionally integrate with the CI/CD pipeline)

```sh

```
